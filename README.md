# RPA (Robotic Process Automation) Project

A RPA project developed in Microsoft Power Automate to automate a repetitive task in the video editing software called CapCut. The RPA goes through all the texts placed in a track as part of a video editing, translates them in Google Translate and paste again in the software, saving a lot of time in video editing process.
